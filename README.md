# Bird Tournaments - Clean Architecture

A starting point for Clean Architecture with ASP.NET Core. [Clean Architecture](https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) is just the latest in a series of names for the same loosely-coupled, dependency-inverted architecture. You will also find it named [hexagonal](http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture), [ports-and-adapters](http://www.dossier-andreas.net/software_architecture/ports_and_adapters.html), or [onion architecture](http://jeffreypalermo.com/blog/the-onion-architecture-part-1/).

This architecture is used in the [DDD Fundamentals course](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/fundamentals-domain-driven-design) by [Steve Smith](https://ardalis.com) and [Julie Lerman](https://thedatafarm.com/). Contact Steve's company, [NimblePros](https://nimblepros.com/), for Clean Architecture or DDD training and/or implementation assistance for your team.

# Getting Started

- clone this repository to your local machine
- open with visual studio 
- click "Build" => "Build Solution"
- config database connection string from src\BirdTournaments.Web\appsettings.json
`
"SqlServerConnection": "YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING"
`


After build the solution, start to migrate or restore the database



## Restore from bak file
- [download the bak file from this link](https://github.com/khangzxrr/BirdTournaments_backend/blob/master/src/BirdTournaments.Web/BirdTournaments.bak)
- restore bak file to database using sql server management studio (2019 up)

**if restore from bak file is not working for you, you can run migration below**

## Running Migrations

In Visual Studio, open the Package Manager Console, and run `Add-Migration ModifyUserVerify -StartupProject BirdTournaments.Web -Context AppDbContext -Project BirdTournaments.Infrastructure`.

`Update-Database -StartupProject BirdTournaments.Web -Context AppDbContext -Project BirdTournaments.Infrastructure`

## The Core Project

The Core project is the center of the Clean Architecture design, and all other project dependencies should point toward it. As such, it has very few external dependencies. The one exception in this case is the `System.Reflection.TypeExtensions` package, which is used by `ValueObject` to help implement its `IEquatable<>` interface. The Core project should include things like:

- Entities
- Aggregates
- Domain Events
- DTOs
- Interfaces
- Event Handlers
- Domain Services
- Specifications

## The SharedKernel Project

Many solutions will also reference a separate **Shared Kernel** project/package. I recommend creating a separate SharedKernel project and solution if you will require sharing code between multiple [bounded contexts](https://ardalis.com/encapsulation-boundaries-large-and-small/) (see [DDD Fundamentals](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/domain-driven-design-fundamentals)). I further recommend this be published as a NuGet package (most likely privately within your organization) and referenced as a NuGet dependency by those projects that require it. For this sample, in the interest of simplicity, I've added a SharedKernel project to the solution. It contains types that would likely be shared between multiple bounded contexts (VS solutions, typically), in my experience. If you want to see an [example of a SharedKernel package, the one I use in my updated Pluralsight DDD course is on NuGet here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PluralsightDdd.SharedKernel/).

## The Infrastructure Project

Most of your application's dependencies on external resources should be implemented in classes defined in the Infrastructure project. These classes should implement interfaces defined in Core. If you have a very large project with many dependencies, it may make sense to have multiple Infrastructure projects (e.g. Infrastructure.Data), but for most projects one Infrastructure project with folders works fine. The sample includes data access and domain event implementations, but you would also add things like email providers, file access, web api clients, etc. to this project so they're not adding coupling to your Core or UI projects.

The Infrastructure project depends on `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer` and `Autofac`. The former is used because it's built into the default ASP.NET Core templates and is the least common denominator of data access. If desired, it can easily be replaced with a lighter-weight ORM like Dapper. Autofac (formerly StructureMap) is used to allow wireup of dependencies to take place closest to where the implementations reside. In this case, an InfrastructureRegistry class can be used in the Infrastructure class to allow wireup of dependencies there, without the entry point of the application even having to have a reference to the project or its types. [Learn more about this technique](https://ardalis.com/avoid-referencing-infrastructure-in-visual-studio-solutions). The current implementation doesn't include this behavior - it's something I typically cover and have students add themselves in my workshops.

## The Web Project

The entry point of the application is the ASP.NET Core web project. This is actually a console application, with a `public static void Main` method in `Program.cs`. It currently uses the default MVC organization (Controllers and Views folders) as well as most of the default ASP.NET Core project template code. This includes its configuration system, which uses the default `appsettings.json` file plus environment variables, and is configured in `Startup.cs`. The project delegates to the `Infrastructure` project to wire up its services using Autofac.

## The Test Projects

Test projects could be organized based on the kind of test (unit, functional, integration, performance, etc.) or by the project they are testing (Core, Infrastructure, Web), or both. For this simple starter kit, the test projects are organized based on the kind of test, with unit, functional and integration test projects existing in this solution. In terms of dependencies, there are three worth noting:

- [xunit](https://www.nuget.org/packages/xunit) I'm using xunit because that's what ASP.NET Core uses internally to test the product. It works great and as new versions of ASP.NET Core ship, I'm confident it will continue to work well with it.

- [Moq](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Moq/) I'm using Moq as a mocking framework for white box behavior-based tests. If I have a method that, under certain circumstances, should perform an action that isn't evident from the object's observable state, mocks provide a way to test that. I could also use my own Fake implementation, but that requires a lot more typing and files. Moq is great once you get the hang of it, and assuming you don't have to mock the world (which we don't in this case because of good, modular design).

- [Microsoft.AspNetCore.TestHost](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.TestHost) I'm using TestHost to test my web project using its full stack, not just unit testing action methods. Using TestHost, you make actual HttpClient requests without going over the wire (so no firewall or port configuration issues). Tests run in memory and are very fast, and requests exercise the full MVC stack, including routing, model binding, model validation, filters, etc.

# Patterns Used

This solution template has code built in to support a few common patterns, especially Domain-Driven Design patterns. Here is a brief overview of how a few of them work.

## Domain Events

Domain events are a great pattern for decoupling a trigger for an operation from its implementation. This is especially useful from within domain entities since the handlers of the events can have dependencies while the entities themselves typically do not. In the sample, you can see this in action with the `ToDoItem.MarkComplete()` method. The following sequence diagram demonstrates how the event and its handler are used when an item is marked complete through a web API endpoint.
